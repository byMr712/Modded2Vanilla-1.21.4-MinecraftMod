# MrModded2Vanilla

A client-side Minecraft mod designed to deliver a smooth and stable multiplayer experience when playing with client content modpacks on vanilla and third-party servers.

## About the Mod

MrModded2Vanilla allows you to play with your favorite content mods (custom blocks, items, mobs, armor, and decorations) in singleplayer while seamlessly joining standard multiplayer servers (including Vanilla, Paper, Purpur, Spigot, Realms, and servers joined via ViaFabricPlus) without having to disable mods or change launcher profiles.

## The Problem Solved

When you install client-side content mods, they register extra attributes, entities, and blocks. When connecting to standard servers, this could previously lead to issues:
- Game crashes when spawning mobs or other players due to unexpected attribute differences.
- Unexpected disconnections caused by unhandled signals or unrecognized item properties.
- Visual glitches and crashes caused by failing cosmetic models or custom animations.

MrModded2Vanilla automatically protects your multiplayer connection and prevents these issues seamlessly.

## Features

- Entity and player sync protection: prevents crashes when loading mobs and players on multiplayer servers.
- Safe model and animation rendering: keeps the game running smoothly even if custom cosmetic models or 3D animations encounter an issue.
- Smart connection protection: stops redundant custom communication that the server does not expect, preventing accidental anti-cheat kicks.
- Safe item interactions: cleans up incompatible creative-mode item properties before sending them across the network.
- Sound and particle safety: filters malformed sound or particle triggers to prevent unexpected connection drops.
- Clean vanilla blocks: ensures standard blocks display reliably and accurately on multiplayer servers.
- Full ViaFabricPlus compatibility: works stably when playing on servers running different Minecraft versions.
- Clean log notice: prints a single clear notice listing any incompatible mod files that received automatic adjustments.

## Automatic Modes

The mod requires zero manual setup and adjusts its behavior automatically:

- Singleplayer: isolation is disabled, all your mods, blocks, items, and custom features work completely normally.
- Standard multiplayer: isolation activates to provide a clean, crash-free vanilla connection.
- Modded multiplayer: mods supported by the server synchronize naturally.
